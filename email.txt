Dear WXYZ,
I immensely dislike you.  It is unbelievable how much you repulse and disgust me.
Your (incredibly annoying voice, snaky/rude/“cool”/”funny”/etc. remarks, unpleasant facial/body features that makes it look like someone took a dump on you, vibe that emanates “I’m better/smarter than you and I don’t really care about anything or anyone except for me”, tendency to speak because you like the sound of your voice) just make me want to vomit out of every place I could.  If I could vomit out of my eyes, I would every time I looked at you.  If I could vomit out of my ears, I would every time I heard your scathing voice.
Why do you keep on bothering everyone?  No one wants to talk to you.  Maybe if you were (nice, pleasant to be around, had better personal hygiene, not such a jerk face), people would enjoy your company.  
You are not (“popular, “cool”, loved by everyone, funny, better than everyone on Earth at everything).  I find you so (icky, yucky, superficial).   
I wish you were a little nicer. You are ruining everyone’s lives by (pestering or annoying them, bullying them, poking fun at the way they look or dress, just being plain ol’ mean), and I have come to the conclusion that most people want you far, far away so you cannot badger them anymore.  It is quite unnerving to have you around, with the constantly rude and inconsiderate crap spewing out of your mouth, especially the (unnecessary swearing, magnitude of your voice, incredible whiny tone of your voice, overall thought of you).
Please, I beg of you: Go away, quit harassing me and others, or change your unwanted attitude.  It really ruins a jocund mood.

Sincerely,
ABCD
